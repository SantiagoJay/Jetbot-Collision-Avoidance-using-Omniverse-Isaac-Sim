Motivation: 

Despite Mark Zuckerburg trying hard to create impact in the consumer & commercial realm, it is the Industrial Metaverse that is said to reach 100B$ of revenues at the end of the decade (ABI Research, 2023) while far outpacing the former two variants. One of the leading use cases will focus on Digital Twins and Simulations related to the factory floor - especially in the context of robots and machinery. For instance car manufacturers such as BMW will first build a digital twin of their factories before committing to it in real life - leading to overall efficiency gains of around 30%.

So where do these efficiency gains come from? Well, for instance current factory workflows get increasingly automatized in the context of dynamically changing supply chains and customer demands. Hence, the speed of training robots' neural networks is a key ingredient for success. By employing digital twins to create situations and scenarios VIRTUALLY, neural networks can be trained magnitudes faster while being more robust at the same time.

To raise general understanding for the benefits of these approaches, sample demo use cases are ideally suited. Hence our initial goal is to adept the model building of basic Jetbot AI use cases to feature simulated training data.
